/datum/species/golem/get_species_description()
	return "Golems, informally known as Moonmen, are typically spacebound alien species of extremophile invertebrates closely related to tardigrades and basilisks. \
	They are predominantly known for their several-inch-thick outer shells, using dense compounds to conceal and protect their insectile, myriapodan bodies. \
	Another unusual feature is their unique metabolism, which is almost wholly reliant on inorganic minerals and raw ores."

	return list(
		"Without their rock layer golems can be easily mistaken as giant myriapods. With an average length of seven feet, the true form of a golem is defined by their cylindrical trunks and tapered heads. \
			Hundreds of sticky cilia- paired in twos- line each flank of a golem's cuticle coated body, their opaque exoskeleton typically grey in coloration. \
			Relying on a mixture of antennae and ocelli for sight, they are one of the few sapient species that can see into the ultraviolet range.",

		"Golems are currently, aside from silicon-based lifeforms, the only recorded species capable of indefinite exposure to the vacuum of space. \
			Although the species lacks a large-scale society which could independently develop spacefaring tech, golems exploit their robust physiology to float through space until they impact a new asteroid or planetary body. \
			Golems trapped in the gravity well of an uncolonized planet seldom have a way to leave, sometimes making them the sole inhabitant.",

		"Those that choose to integrate into society undergo a miraculous process not dissimilar to a plasmaman's fungal colony. By coupling with one to three other golems, the group creates a single humanoid-shaped body called a family unit. \
			Family units typically have one member independently controlling a limb, interchangeably swapping roles as the hands or feet in a form of facultative bipedalism. \
			Whereas plasmamen coalesce into hivemind colonies, golems in a family unit remain as independently thinking entities.",

		"Still, many live hermetic lifestyles as recluses, content with a simple life grazing on ores divorced from societal life. \
			These golems typically retain their mono-bodied forms, only coupling with other golems to reproduce or to form a family unit in times of resource scarcity. \
			In rare cases, these hermits will congregate into aggressive organized colonies. \
			The most recent recording of this phenomena occurred on Mars, when an Akhter colonization project had unknowingly disturbed a colony of moonmen who had been living in the red planet's subterranean.",
